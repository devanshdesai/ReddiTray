### Looking for a new maintainer

If interested send me a message on Gitter or Email.

It's probably best to use the raw API, or look into alternatives due
to the lack of updates this library will receive here on out. Reddit
seems to have an official API in the works which may be worth a go:

# Snoocore

A minimal and complete JavaScript driver for the Reddit API.
