## Synopsis
ReddiTray is a desktop tray application that notifies you when you have unread Reddit messages and allows you to read your messages and mark them as read. It is a complete, stand-alone solution for Reddit messages without the need of the traditional web browser.


### Motivation
The motivation for this project was to primarily to explore Github Electron and Node JS. To me, the idea of creating desktop applications using web technologies is an absolute game-changer. The desktop application space is much easier to develop in if you simply know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


### Technologies
ReddiTray is built on Github Electron and uses Vue.js, the Reddit API, Snoocore, and Marked.js.


### Compability
The application is compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.
