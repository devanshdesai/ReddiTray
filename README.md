ReddiTray is a desktop tray application that notifies you when you have unread Reddit messages and allows you to read your messages and mark them as read. It is a complete, stand-alone solution for Reddit messages without the need of the traditional web browser.

ReddiTray is built on Github Electron and uses Vue.js, the Reddit API, Snoocore, and Marked.js.

The application is compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.
